# TolissXKeyPadHelper
A simple XKeyPad layout and lua file for some common functions in the Toliss A321 to make flying a little bit easier.

## Installation

Firstly you require:
   * XPlane 12
   + The Toliss A321 ( v1.7+ ) for XPlane 12
   + XKeyPad ( v1.6.1 or better )
   + FlyWithLuaNG ( v2.8.XX NG )

You now have to place the 3 files `X-Keys_a321_StdDef.jaon`, `X-Keys_a321.json` and `X-Keys_a321_StdDef.ini`  in your Toliss A321 directory, which should be in `X-Plane12\Aurcraft\TolissA321_V1p7`  (NB: the specific name ofthe TolissA321 directory does change with versions, but the lastest iv V1p7).

Then place the file `TolissCustom.lua` into the FlyWithLua scripts directory which should be `X-Plane 12\Resources\plugins\FlyWithLua\Scripts`

Start X-Plane 12.
